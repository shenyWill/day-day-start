       "      \u001b[32m\"learning class. So what I wanna do today is just spend a little time going over the logistics \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"of the class, and then we'll start to talk a bit about machine learning.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"By way of introduction, my name's Andrew Ng and I'll be instructor for this class. And so \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"I personally work in machine learning, and I've worked on it for about 15 years now, and \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"I actually think that machine learning is the most exciting field of all the computer \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"sciences. So I'm actually always excited about teaching this class. Sometimes I actually \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"think that machine learning is not only the most exciting thing in computer science, but \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"the most exciting thing in all of human endeavor, so maybe a little bias there.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"I also want to introduce the TAs, who are all graduate students doing research in or \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"related to the machine learning and all aspects of machine learning. Paul Baumstarck \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"fundamentals of human learning. Zico Kolter is the head TA — he's head TA two years \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"in a row now — works in machine learning and applies them to a bunch of robots. And \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Daniel Ramage is — I guess he's not here — Daniel applies learning algorithms to \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"So you'll get to know the TAs and me much better throughout this quarter, but just from \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"the sorts of things the TA's do, I hope you can already tell that machine learning is a \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"highly interdisciplinary topic in which just the TAs find learning algorithms to problems \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"in computer vision and biology and robots and language. And machine learning is one of \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"those things that has and is having a large impact on many applications.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So just in my own daily work, I actually frequently end up talking to people like \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"helicopter pilots to biologists to people in computer systems or databases to economists \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"So yeah, this is fun. A couple of weeks ago, a student actually forwarded to me an article \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"topping the list was actually machine learning. So I think this is a good time to be \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"learning. I feel that machine learning grew out of early work in AI, early work in artificial \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"intelligence. And over the last — I wanna say last 15 or last 20 years or so, it's been \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"viewed as a sort of growing new capability for computers. And in particular, it turns out \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"that there are many programs or there are many applications that you can't program by \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"longhand. And other things: One thing that my students and I do is autonomous flight. It \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"turns out to be extremely difficult to sit down and write a program to fly a helicopter.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"But in contrast, if you want to do things like to get software to fly a helicopter or have \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"software recognize handwritten digits, one very successful approach is to use a learning \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"algorithm and have a computer learn by itself how to, say, recognize your handwriting. \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"And in fact, handwritten digit recognition, this is pretty much the only approach that \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"So earlier this year, I approached SCPD, which televises these classes, about trying to \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"make a small number of Stanford classes publicly available or posting the videos on the \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"web. And so this year, Stanford is actually starting a small pilot program in which we'll \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"So what is machine learning? Way back in about 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"Arthur Samuel had his program play thousands of games against itself, and over time it \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"Here's a more recent, a more modern, more formal definition of machine learning due to \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Tom Mitchell, who says that a well-posed learning problem is defined as follows: He \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"says that a computer program is set to learn from an experience E with respect to some \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"task T and some performance measure P if its performance on T as measured by P \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"improves with experience E. Okay. So not only is it a definition, it even rhymes.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So, for example, in the case of checkers, the experience E that a program has would be \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"the experience of playing lots of games of checkers against itself, say. The task T is the \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"task of playing checkers, and the performance measure P will be something like the \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"fraction of games it wins against a certain set of human opponents. And by this \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"definition, we'll say that Arthur Samuel's checkers program has learned to play checkers, \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"So as an overview of what we're going to do in this class, this class is sort of organized \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"into four major sections. We're gonna talk about four major topics in this class, the first \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"of which is supervised learning. So let me give you an example of that.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So suppose you collect a data set of housing prices. And one of the TAs, Dan Ramage, \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"actually collected a data set for me last week to use in the example later. But suppose that \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"you go to collect statistics about how much houses cost in a certain geographic area. And \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Dan, the TA, collected data from housing prices in Portland, Oregon. So what you can do \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"is let's say plot the square footage of the house against the list price of the house, right, so \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"you collect data on a bunch of houses. And let's say you get a data set like this with \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"houses of different sizes that are listed for different amounts of money.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Now, let's say that I'm trying to sell a house in the same area as Portland, Oregon as \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"where the data comes from. Let's say I have a house that's this size in square footage, and \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"I want an algorithm to tell me about how much should I expect my house to sell for. So \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"there are lots of ways to do this, and some of you may have seen elements of what I'm \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"about to say before.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So one thing you could do is look at this data and maybe put a straight line to it. And then \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"if this is my house, you may then look at the straight line and predict that my house is \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"gonna go for about that much money, right? There are other decisions that we can make, \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"which we'll talk about later, which is, well, what if I don't wanna put a straight line? \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Maybe I should put a quadratic function to it. Maybe that fits the data a little bit better. \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"You notice if you do that, the price of my house goes up a bit, so that'd be nice.  \"\u001b[39m,\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"what's called a supervised learning problem. And the reason that it's called supervised \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"learning is because we're providing the algorithm a data set of a bunch of square \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"footages, a bunch of housing sizes, and as well as sort of the right answer of what the \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"So we call this supervised learning because we're supervising the algorithm or, in other \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"words, we're giving the algorithm the, quote, right answer for a number of houses. And \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"then we want the algorithm to learn the association between the inputs and the outputs \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"and to sort of give us more of the right answers, okay?  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"It turns out this specific example that I drew here is an example of something called a \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"regression problem. And the term regression sort of refers to the fact that the variable \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"you're trying to predict is a continuous value and price.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"There's another class of supervised learning problems which we'll talk about, which are \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"classification problems. And so, in a classification problem, the variable you're trying to \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"predict is discreet rather than continuous. So as one specific example — so actually a \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"standard data set you can download online [inaudible] that lots of machine learning \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"people have played with. Let's say you collect a data set on breast cancer tumors, and you \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"want to learn the algorithm to predict whether or not a certain tumor is malignant. \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Malignant is the opposite of benign, right, so malignancy is a sort of harmful, bad tumor. \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So we collect some number of features, some number of properties of these tumors, and \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"for the sake of sort of having a simple [inaudible] explanation, let's just say that we're \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"going to look at the size of the tumor and depending on the size of the tumor, we'll try to \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"figure out whether or not the tumor is malignant or benign.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So the tumor is either malignant or benign, and so the variable in the Y axis is either zero \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"or 1, and so your data set may look something like that, right? And that's 1 and that's \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"zero, okay? And so this is an example of a classification problem where the variable \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"you're trying to predict is a discreet value. It's either zero or 1.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"And in fact, more generally, there will be many learning problems where we'll have more \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"than one input variable, more than one input feature and use more than one variable to try \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"to predict, say, whether a tumor is malignant or benign. So, for example, continuing with \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"Saxena and Min Sun here did, which is given an image like this, right? This is actually a \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"we take this clustering and use it to build a 3D model of the world? And so using the \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"clustering, they then had a learning algorithm try to learn what the 3D structure of the \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"world looks like so that they could come up with a 3D model that you can sort of fly \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"through, okay? Although many people used to think it's not possible to take a single \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"image and build a 3D model, but using a learning algorithm and that sort of clustering \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"algorithm is the first step. They were able to.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"I'll just show you one more example. I like this because it's a picture of Stanford with our \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"beautiful Stanford campus. So again, taking the same sort of clustering algorithms, taking \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"the same sort of unsupervised learning algorithm, you can group the pixels into different \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"regions. And using that as a pre-processing step, they eventually built this sort of 3D \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"model of Stanford campus in a single picture. You can sort of walk into the ceiling, look \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"around the campus. Okay? This actually turned out to be a mix of supervised and \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"unsupervised learning, but the unsupervised learning, this sort of clustering was the first \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"So it turns out these sorts of unsupervised — clustering algorithms are actually routinely \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "      \u001b[32m\"So imagine a large cocktail party with lots of people. So the problem is, is that all of these \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",

       "    pageContent: \u001b[32m\"And as an aside, this algorithm I just showed you, it seems like it must be a pretty \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"complicated algorithm, right, to take this overlapping audio streams and separate them \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"out. It sounds like a pretty complicated thing to do. So you're gonna ask how complicated \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"is it really to implement an algorithm like this? It turns out if you do it in MATLAB, you \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"can do it in one line of code.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So I got this from Samuel Wyse at Toronto, U of Toronto, and the example I showed you \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"actually used a more complicated ICA algorithm than this. But nonetheless, I guess this is \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"why for this class I'm going to ask you to do most of your programming in MATLAB and \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Octave because if you try to implement the same algorithm in C or Java or something, I \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"can tell you from personal, painful experience, you end up writing pages and pages of \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"code rather than relatively few lines of code. I'll also mention that it did take researchers \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"many, many years to come up with that one line of code, so this is not easy.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So that was unsupervised learning, and then the last of the four major topics I wanna tell \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"you about is reinforcement learning. And this refers to problems where you don't do one-\\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"shot decision-making. So, for example, in the supervised learning cancer prediction \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"problem, you have a patient come in, you predict that the cancer is malignant or benign. \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"And then based on your prediction, maybe the patient lives or dies, and then that's it, \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"right? So you make a decision and then there's a consequence. You either got it right or \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"wrong. In reinforcement learning problems, you are usually asked to make a sequence of \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"decisions over time.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So, for example, this is something that my students and I work on. If I give you the keys \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"to an autonomous helicopter — we actually have this helicopter here at Stanford, — how \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"do you write a program to make it fly, right? You notice that if you make a wrong \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"decision on a helicopter, the consequence of crashing it may not happen until much later. \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"And in fact, usually you need to make a whole sequence of bad decisions to crash a \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"helicopter. But conversely, you also need to make a whole sequence of good decisions in \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"order to fly a helicopter really well.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So I'm gonna show you some fun videos of learning algorithms flying helicopters. This is \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"a video of our helicopter at Stanford flying using a controller that was learned using a \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"reinforcement learning algorithm. So this was done on the Stanford football field, and \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"we'll zoom out the camera in a second. You'll sort of see the trees planted in the sky. So \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"maybe this is one of the most difficult aerobatic maneuvers flown on any helicopter under \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"computer control. And this controller, which is very, very hard for a human to sit down \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"and write out, was learned using one of these reinforcement learning algorithms.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Just a word about that: The basic idea behind a reinforcement learning algorithm is this \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"idea of what's called a reward function. What we have to think about is imagine you're \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m'trying to train a dog. So every time your dog does something good, you say, \"Good dog,\" \\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m'and you reward the dog. Every time your dog does something bad, you go, \"Bad dog,\" \\n'\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"right? And hopefully, over time, your dog will learn to do the right things to get more of \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m'the positive rewards, to get more of the \"Good dogs\" and to get fewer of the \"Bad dogs.”  '\u001b[39m,\n",
