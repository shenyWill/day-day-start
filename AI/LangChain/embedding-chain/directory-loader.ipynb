       "      \u001b[32m\"Instructor (Andrew Ng): Okay. Good morning. Welcome to CS229, the machine \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"learning class. So what I wanna do today is just spend a little time going over the logistics \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"of the class, and then we'll start to talk a bit about machine learning.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"By way of introduction, my name's Andrew Ng and I'll be instructor for this class. And so \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"I personally work in machine learning, and I've worked on it for about 15 years now, and \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"I actually think that machine learning is the most exciting field of all the computer \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"sciences. So I'm actually always excited about teaching this class. Sometimes I actually \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"think that machine learning is not only the most exciting thing in computer science, but \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"the most exciting thing in all of human endeavor, so maybe a little bias there.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"I also want to introduce the TAs, who are all graduate students doing research in or \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"related to the machine learning and all aspects of machine learning. Paul Baumstarck \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"works in machine learning and computer vision. Catie Chang is actually a neuroscientist \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"who applies machine learning algorithms to try to understand the human brain. Tom Do \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"is another PhD student, works in computational biology and in sort of the basic \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"fundamentals of human learning. Zico Kolter is the head TA — he's head TA two years \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"in a row now — works in machine learning and applies them to a bunch of robots. And \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Daniel Ramage is — I guess he's not here — Daniel applies learning algorithms to \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"problems in natural language processing.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So you'll get to know the TAs and me much better throughout this quarter, but just from \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"the sorts of things the TA's do, I hope you can already tell that machine learning is a \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"highly interdisciplinary topic in which just the TAs find learning algorithms to problems \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"in computer vision and biology and robots and language. And machine learning is one of \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"those things that has and is having a large impact on many applications.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So just in my own daily work, I actually frequently end up talking to people like \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"helicopter pilots to biologists to people in computer systems or databases to economists \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"and sort of also an unending stream of people from industry coming to Stanford \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"interested in applying machine learning methods to their own problems.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So yeah, this is fun. A couple of weeks ago, a student actually forwarded to me an article \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m`in \"Computer World\" about the 12 IT skills that employers can't say no to. So it's about \\n`\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"sort of the 12 most desirable skills in all of IT and all of information technology, and \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"topping the list was actually machine learning. So I think this is a good time to be \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"learning this stuff and learning algorithms and having a large impact on many segments \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"of science and industry.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"I'm actually curious about something. Learning algorithms is one of the things that \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"touches many areas of science and industries, and I'm just kind of curious. How many \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"people here are computer science majors, are in the computer science department? Okay. \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"About half of you. How many people are from EE? Oh, okay, maybe about a fifth. How \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"\\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"many biologers are there here? Wow, just a few, not many. I'm surprised. Anyone from \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"statistics? Okay, a few. So where are the rest of you from?  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Student : iCME.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Instructor (Andrew Ng) : Say again?  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Student : iCME.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Instructor (Andrew Ng) : iCME. Cool.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Student : [Inaudible].  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Instructor (Andrew Ng) : Civi and what else?  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Student : [Inaudible]  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Instructor (Andrew Ng) : Synthesis, [inaudible] systems. Yeah, cool.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Student : Chemi.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Instructor (Andrew Ng) : Chemi. Cool.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Student : [Inaudible].  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Instructor (Andrew Ng) : Aero/astro. Yes, right. Yeah, okay, cool. Anyone else?  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Student : [Inaudible].  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Instructor (Andrew Ng) : Pardon? MSNE. All right. Cool. Yeah.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Student : [Inaudible].  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Instructor (Andrew Ng) : Pardon?  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Student : [Inaudible].  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Instructor (Andrew Ng) : Endo —  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Student : [Inaudible].  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Instructor (Andrew Ng) : Oh, I see, industry. Okay. Cool. Great, great. So as you can \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"tell from a cross-section of this class, I think we're a very diverse audience in this room, \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"and that's one of the things that makes this class fun to teach and fun to be in, I think.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"\\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So in this class, we've tried to convey to you a broad set of principles and tools that will \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"be useful for doing many, many things. And every time I teach this class, I can actually \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"very confidently say that after December, no matter what you're going to do after this \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"December when you've sort of completed this class, you'll find the things you learn in \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"this class very useful, and these things will be useful pretty much no matter what you end \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"up doing later in your life.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So I have more logistics to go over later, but let's say a few more words about machine \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"learning. I feel that machine learning grew out of early work in AI, early work in artificial \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"intelligence. And over the last — I wanna say last 15 or last 20 years or so, it's been \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"viewed as a sort of growing new capability for computers. And in particular, it turns out \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"that there are many programs or there are many applications that you can't program by \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"hand.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"For example, if you want to get a computer to read handwritten characters, to read sort of \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"handwritten digits, that actually turns out to be amazingly difficult to write a piece of \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"software to take this input, an image of something that I wrote and to figure out just what \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"it is, to translate my cursive handwriting into — to extract the characters I wrote out in \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"longhand. And other things: One thing that my students and I do is autonomous flight. It \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"turns out to be extremely difficult to sit down and write a program to fly a helicopter.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"But in contrast, if you want to do things like to get software to fly a helicopter or have \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"software recognize handwritten digits, one very successful approach is to use a learning \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"algorithm and have a computer learn by itself how to, say, recognize your handwriting. \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"And in fact, handwritten digit recognition, this is pretty much the only approach that \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"works well. It uses applications that are hard to program by hand.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Learning algorithms has also made I guess significant inroads in what's sometimes called \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"database mining. So, for example, with the growth of IT and computers, increasingly \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"many hospitals are keeping around medical records of what sort of patients, what \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"problems they had, what their prognoses was, what the outcome was. And taking all of \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"these medical records, which started to be digitized only about maybe 15 years, applying \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"learning algorithms to them can turn raw medical records into what I might loosely call \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"medical knowledge in which we start to detect trends in medical practice and even start to \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"alter medical practice as a result of medical knowledge that's derived by applying \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"learning algorithms to the sorts of medical records that hospitals have just been building \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"over the last 15, 20 years in an electronic format.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Turns out that most of you probably use learning algorithms — I don't know — I think \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"half a dozen times a day or maybe a dozen times a day or more, and often without \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"knowing it. So, for example, every time you send mail via the US Postal System, turns \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"out there's an algorithm that tries to automatically read the zip code you wrote on your \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"envelope, and that's done by a learning algorithm. So every time you send US mail, you \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"are using a learning algorithm, perhaps without even being aware of it.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"\\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Similarly, every time you write a check, I actually don't know the number for this, but a \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"significant fraction of checks that you write are processed by a learning algorithm that's \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"learned to read the digits, so the dollar amount that you wrote down on your check. So \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"every time you write a check, there's another learning algorithm that you're probably \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"using without even being aware of it.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"If you use a credit card, or I know at least one phone company was doing this, and lots of \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"companies like eBay as well that do electronic transactions, there's a good chance that \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"there's a learning algorithm in the background trying to figure out if, say, your credit \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"card's been stolen or if someone's engaging in a fraudulent transaction.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"If you use a website like Amazon or Netflix that will often recommend books for you to \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"buy or movies for you to rent or whatever, these are other examples of learning \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"algorithms that have learned what sorts of things you like to buy or what sorts of movies \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"you like to watch and can therefore give customized recommendations to you.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"Just about a week ago, I had my car serviced, and even there, my car mechanic was trying \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"to explain to me some learning algorithm in the innards of my car that's sort of doing its \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"best to optimize my driving performance for fuel efficiency or something.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So, see, most of us use learning algorithms half a dozen, a dozen, maybe dozens of times \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"without even knowing it.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"And of course, learning algorithms are also doing things like giving us a growing \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"understanding of the human genome. So if someday we ever find a cure for cancer, I bet \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"learning algorithms will have had a large role in that. That's sort of the thing that Tom \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"works on, yes?  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"So in teaching this class, I sort of have three goals. One of them is just to I hope convey \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"some of my own excitement about machine learning to you.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"The second goal is by the end of this class, I hope all of you will be able to apply state-of-\\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"the-art machine learning algorithms to whatever problems you're interested in. And if you \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"ever need to build a system for reading zip codes, you'll know how to do that by the end \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"of this class.  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"And lastly, by the end of this class, I realize that only a subset of you are interested in \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"doing research in machine learning, but by the conclusion of this class, I hope that all of \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
       "      \u001b[32m\"you will actually be well qualified to start doing research in machine learning, okay?  \\n\"\u001b[39m +\n",
